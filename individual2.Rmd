##### Searching for the Best Chocolates  
1. How are the ratings distributed?
```{r}
hist(choco$Rating)
boxplot(choco$Rating)
```
  
The ratings are skewed left, with most ratings above the halfway mark of 2.5. We can see from the boxplot that the median is around 3.3 and there are roughly 4 outliers all around or below a rating of 2.  

2. How does the number of ratings depend on year?
```{r}
barplot(table(choco$Date))
```
  
The number of ratings per year is generally increasing until 2015, and it generally decreases after that, with a notably few ratings in 2017.
